# BTD-112
A spinoff of the Bloons Tower Defense games that I made for a final term project for 15112 - A Carnegie Mellon Intro Computer Science Couse


Description: 
This project is called BTD 112, my own personal take on the game BTD 5 with some of the jankiness that comes 
a 2 week Python project. It plays almost the same, but you can place monkeys anywehre on screen, even on the track!
It has the same splitting mechanics on the bloons as well as a good variety of towers (including one that I hand made)
(try and guess which on ). 

How to run:
Download the zip file (I promise it is not a zipbomb 💣💥🖥️🤯✖️) named "Bloons 112" and you should be able to run it by running the Bloons TD 112.py file as everything else is local. 


Shortcuts:
Pressing the ',' or '<' key will preform a left upgrade quickly as long as a monkey is selected and your cash amount is 
sufficient 

Pressing the '.' or '>' key will preform a right upgrade quickly as long as a monkey is selected and your cash amount is 
sufficient

Extra Libraries/Fonts:
No extra libraries or fonts are being used so dont worry about downloading any more dependencies
